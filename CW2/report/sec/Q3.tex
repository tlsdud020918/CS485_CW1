\subsection{Optimizing hyperparameters}
We conducted experiments in a procedure similar to Section2 to find the optimal parameters for the Random Forest vocabulary. The results are shown in \cref{subsec:Q3-app1}. When $N$ (number of trees) = 8, $D$ (depth of trees) = 6, $\rho$ (number of attempts to split per node) = 10, we achieved sufficiently good performance with test accuracy of 60.67\% and the vocabulary size = 256.

\subsection{Comparison with Q2's result}
